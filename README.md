##What is this?
Bop Browser is a free-to-use web application that provides a directory of music information. Users are able to search and browse music information for different artists, albums, and songs. 

Currently, all data is provided by the [Deezer API](https://developers.deezer.com/)

##What's it gonna be?
Planned releases for this web app aim towards building a tool that will allow users to generate playlists based on input artists, albums, and songs. Future APIs might be brought in to achieve this.

##But like, what's this actually?
This application is mostly a hobby project of mine with no real intention but to build something useful and practice my engineering and development skills. Actual contribution to this repo depends on my free time and willingness.
